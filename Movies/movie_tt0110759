After trying to pawn the pre-freshman off on his house mate, Droz sets off on his normal daily activities including disrupting a political protest by throwing meat at a group of vegan protesters. The President of the University then receives a number of complaints, and with the help of her lackey, she may finally have the power to kick Droz's house off campus. But the Pit throws an all-campus rager where George Clinton and the Parliament Funkadelic performs, and everything might turn out alright if the various political groups can forget their protests for one night and just have fun together.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFiMjk0OTAtZGJkNC00NTUzLTg3YmItYzBkNjM1ODFhMmFkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '47%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '42/100'}], 'Metascore': '42', 'imdbRating': '6.6', 'imdbVotes': '11,251', 'imdbID': 'tt0110759', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '02 Sep 2003', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
