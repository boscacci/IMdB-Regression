Marcos steps in, claiming to be a policeman, and drags Juan out of the store. Once they are back on the street, Marcos reveals himself to be a fellow swindler with a game of much higher stakes in mind, and he invites Juan to be his partner in crime. A once-in-a-lifetime scheme seemingly falls into their laps - an old-time con man enlists them to sell a forged set of extremely valuable rare stamps, The Nine Queens. The tricky negotiations that ensue bring into the picture a cast of suspicious characters, including Marcos' sister Valeria, their younger brother Federico and a slew of thieves, conmen and pickpockets. As the deceptions mount, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out who is conning whom.", 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Country': 'Argentina', 'Awards': '22 wins & 8 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDdlYjItMDVkYy00MjYzLThhMTYtYjIzZjZiODk1ZWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '80/100'}], 'Metascore': '80', 'imdbRating': '7.9', 'imdbVotes': '44,835', 'imdbID': 'tt0247586', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '01 Oct 2002', 'BoxOffice': '$1,078,919', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures Classics', 'Website': 'http://www.magiclanternpr.com/films/Nine_Queens.htm', 'Response': 'True'}
