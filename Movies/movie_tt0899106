His wife died in a car accident three years ago. He's in Seattle to lead a week-long workshop on healing and to negotiate a major multi-media deal. But something's amiss: he's a closet drinker, he won't ride elevators, his moods swing, he's estranged from his wife's father, and he's very much alone. In a hotel hallway, he bumps into a woman arranging flowers, tries to chat with her, and gets the brush-off. She's Eloise, a local florist who's just broken up with a boyfriend. He's persistent and they eventually go to dinner - it goes badly. What's blocking Burke? Can the physician heal himself.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Canada, UK', 'Awards': '1 win.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1ODc4NjkyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA1MjU2Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '17%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '33/100'}], 'Metascore': '33', 'imdbRating': '5.7', 'imdbVotes': '28,254', 'imdbID': 'tt0899106', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '02 Feb 2010', 'BoxOffice': '$22,927,390', 'Production': 'Universal Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.lovehappensmovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
