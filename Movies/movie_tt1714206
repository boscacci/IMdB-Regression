A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he\'s the life of the party, loves his job at a men\'s clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he\'s never far from his supersized, whiskey-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finecky hovering over him. She\'s different: the "nice girl" who reads science fiction and doesn\'t have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they\'re drawn together.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '10 wins & 31 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTc0NTkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwNjE3OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '82/100'}], 'Metascore': '82', 'imdbRating': '7.1', 'imdbVotes': '130,386', 'imdbID': 'tt1714206', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '14 Jan 2014', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'A24', 'Website': 'http://spectacularnowmovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
