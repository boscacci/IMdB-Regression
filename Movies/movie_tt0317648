In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American, Frank T. Hopkins, and his horse to enter the race for the first time. During the course of his career, Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry--and had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The Sheik puts his claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world's greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders--some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival as he and his horse attempt the impossible.", 'Language': 'English, Arabic, Sioux', 'Country': 'USA, Morocco', 'Awards': '1 win & 2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNjg5MjcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQxMzQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '46%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '54/100'}], 'Metascore': '54', 'imdbRating': '6.7', 'imdbVotes': '72,866', 'imdbID': 'tt0317648', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '03 Aug 2004', 'BoxOffice': '$67,249,474', 'Production': 'Buena Vista Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.disney.com/hidalgo', 'Response': 'True'}
