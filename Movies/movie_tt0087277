When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he\'s in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can\'t quite believe he\'s living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and "Let\'s Hear It for the Boy".', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'Nominated for 2 Oscars.
