Brainy Casey Carlyle has never quite fit in. Caught between her fantasy of becoming a championship figure skater and her strong-willed mother, who has her on the fast track to Harvard, she can only hope to be like Nikki, Tiffany and Gen--three elite skating prodigies who are ruthlessly competing on the US National circuit (and have attitudes to match). But when Casey gets the chance to train with Gen and her coach, a disgraced former skating champion who also happens to be Gen\'s mother, she must dash her own mother\'s hopes in order to pursue her dream. Now, with only the support of Gen\'s teenage brother, a hunky Zamboni driver, Casey takes on the challenge of her life when she finds herself competing against the best to make it into the championship circuit and become a real "ice princess."', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Canada', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NjIzMzg5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI2ODcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '52%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '55/100'}], 'Metascore': '55', 'imdbRating': '6.0', 'imdbVotes': '22,534', 'imdbID': 'tt0396652', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '19 Jul 2005', 'BoxOffice': '$24,381,334', 'Production': 'Buena Vista Pictures', 'Website': 'http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/iceprincess', 'Response': 'True'}
