Her life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital, until one rainy night, her sister Jenna abandons her newborn, autistic daughter at her home. Maggie takes the baby in, and she becomes the daughter she never had. Six years later Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric, and abducts Cody. Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis, an expert in ritual homicide and occult-related crime, takes up her cause when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children. The little girl, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply "special." She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Germany', 'Awards': '1 win & 6 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwMmRiZDktMjMzMy00ZGZhLTlmNDItN2M3Yjc3MGExNzAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '3%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '17/100'}], 'Metascore': '17', 'imdbRating': '5.1', 'imdbVotes': '13,037', 'imdbID': 'tt0163983', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '13 Feb 2001', 'BoxOffice': '$28,134,407', 'Production': 'Paramount Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.blessthechild.com', 'Response': 'True'}
