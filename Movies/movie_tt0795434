Shortly thereafter she gave birth to Jasmeet. Manmohan was always embarrassed of Bebo, as she was overly healthy and not quite sophisticated, as a result he always left her at home, while he socialized. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so got her admitted in an English Medium school, encouraged to mingle with Caucasian friends, and as a result Jasmeet was transformed in to Jazz - a stunningly beautiful young woman, British in looks, talk, habits, and heart. Manmohan's plans to get her married to an Indian boy are all in vain. His friend, Parvez Khan, is in a similar situation with his son, Imran, openly romancing a Caucasian blonde, Susan. Manmohan decides to take his family for a tour in India, and ends up getting her married to Arjun Singh. On their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she is getting married to Charles Brown, who is well connected, even with Prince Charles, and refuses to recognize her marriage with Arjun as there is no proof of this wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to considerable racial profiling (snake charmers, Indian rope tricks, tandoori chicken) as well as a quote from Winston Churchil to wit: 'When we leave India, the country will be in the hands of goons'. while Imran is asked by Susan's parents to fore-go Islam, become a Christian, change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide a written undertaking that his family is not associated with any terrorists. The questions that remain unanswered are: will love prevail ! Between Imran and Susan on one hand, and Jasmeet and Charles on the other? What is the impact of this marriage on Arjun, who now has been demoted from Husband to the Best Man?", 'Language': 'Hindi, German, Italian', 'Country': 'India', 'Awards': '1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E3OGZiZjgtMDYzYy00OWIzLTlmZDItOWEwYWE5MjdmMWFjL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.3/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '7.3', 'imdbVotes': '18,967', 'imdbID': 'tt0795434', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '05 Jun 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$1,000,000', 'Production': 'Eros Entertainment', 'Website': 'http://erosentertainment.com/namasteylondon/', 'Response': 'True'}
