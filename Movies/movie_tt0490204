Yet he feels isolated because he finds having a hard-working job and managing a family too much to handle and has no one to talk to about it. Charlie Fineman, on the other hand, doesn't have a job or a family. He used to have both until a terrible loss, and the grief caused him to quit his job and isolate himself from everyone around him. As it turns out, Alan and Charlie were roommates in college, and a chance encounter one night rekindles the friendship they shared. But when Charlie's problems become too much to deal with, Alan is determined to help Charlie come out of his emotional abyss.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMTExNTgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY4MTEzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '64%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '61/100'}], 'Metascore': '61', 'imdbRating': '7.5', 'imdbVotes': '89,225', 'imdbID': 'tt0490204', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 Oct 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$19,661,987', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/reignoverme/index.html', 'Response': 'True'}
