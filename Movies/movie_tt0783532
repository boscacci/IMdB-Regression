Soon, Lucky realizes he needs a bigger score to fulfill his goals of making it big, and escaping from the slums, to a dream house by the sea. Kunene hatches an elaborate and violent plan to make his fortune - hijacking buildings from landlords of Johannesburg tenements by winning the favor of the tenants and then holding their rent hostage from the landowners. His high-profile real estate acquisitions attract the attention of the local police force who have no qualms about using unprovoked brutality to bring him down. His trouble with the law, coupled with an escalating war between a local drug lord, creates a tense standoff: both sides are closing in, and Kunene must stay one step ahead--or his empire, and his life, will come crashing down.', 'Language': 'English, Afrikaans', 'Country': 'South Africa', 'Awards': '6 wins & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTkyMzMzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNDk0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '76%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '53/100'}], 'Metascore': '53', 'imdbRating': '7.7', 'imdbVotes': '9,984', 'imdbID': 'tt0783532', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '28 Sep 2010', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Anchor Bay Films', 'Website': 'http://www.gangstersparadisejerusalema.com', 'Response': 'True'}
