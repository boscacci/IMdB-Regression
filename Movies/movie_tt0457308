In a town near Little Rock, Lucy Fowler works hard for a construction firm; on weekends she drinks, goes home with someone, and come early morning, wakes and leaves as fast as she can. She cares a lot about her father, newly back in town, a painfully shy man who has nothing to say to her. She does go to a Holy Roller church with him about the same time that she starts, fitfully, a relationship with Cal Percell, new in town and a good guy. She kisses him sober, but still has demons to confront. What's the source of her careless ways; can she turn coal into a diamond?", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMDc0NjI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTExMjA0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.2/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '83%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '64/100'}], 'Metascore': '64', 'imdbRating': '6.2', 'imdbVotes': '2,416', 'imdbID': 'tt0457308', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '20 Mar 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$50,160', 'Production': 'IDP Distribution', 'Website': 'http://www.comeearlymorningthefilm.com', 'Response': 'True'}
