When his wife Sarah falls off the wagon and dumps him for Jacques, a drug dealer, Frank tries to get her back by reporting her kidnapped, grabbing her from Jacques' car, and wailing for her to return. After watching Christian TV and having a vision, he becomes a superhero to fight evil. He sews a costume, finds a weapon (a pipe wrench) and looks for crimes to stop. He has problems: his wrench inflicts real injury, so the cops want him for being a vigilante, his sense of boundaries is flawed, and Jacques' gang has guns. Libby, a clerk at a comic book store, becomes his sidekick, and it's time to go save Sarah. What chance do they have?", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMDkxNjI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE5Njc1NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '49%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '50/100'}], 'Metascore': '50', 'imdbRating': '6.8', 'imdbVotes': '69,483', 'imdbID': 'tt1512235', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 Aug 2011', 'BoxOffice': '$200,000', 'Production': 'IFC Midnight', 'Website': 'http://www.thecrimsonbolt.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
