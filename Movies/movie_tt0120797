They thrive on the no-room-for-error, fast-paced job and let it infect their lives. The undisputed king of pushing tin, "The Zone" Falzone, rules his workplace and his wedded life with the same short-attention span that gets planes where they need to be in the nick of time. That is, until Russell Bell, a new transfer with a reputation for recklessness but a record of pure perfection shatters the tensely-held status quo. The game of one-upmanship between the two flies so high as to lead Nick into Russell\'s bed with his wife. His sanity slipping just as fast as his hold on #1, Cusack\'s controller is thrown out-of-control when Thornton\'s wanderer quietly leaves town. Nick must now find a way to regain his sanity and repair his marriage before he breaks down completely.', 'Language': 'English, French', 'Country': 'USA, Germany', 'Awards': '2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNiMDdmNzUtOWE0MC00MjViLTkyOTctYTI0ZmUzOTU4ZTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '48%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '47/100'}], 'Metascore': '47', 'imdbRating': '6.0', 'imdbVotes': '26,540', 'imdbID': 'tt0120797', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '14 Aug 2001', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment', 'Website': 'http://www.foxmovies.com/pushingtin', 'Response': 'True'}
