As Bob the Tomato and the kids settle in to wait for a tow truck to help get their van back on the road, the "Pirates Who Don\'t Do Anything" share a little story about a guy named Jonah. Jonah was kind of like a mailman except his messages came straight from God. Jonah loves his job, until the day comes when he has to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh. Instead of carrying out his mission, Jonah turns and sets sail in the opposite direction onboard a pirate ship. Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, UK', 'Awards': '2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0OTk5MTk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgxMDg5._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '66%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '58/100'}], 'Metascore': '58', 'imdbRating': '6.6', 'imdbVotes': '3,392', 'imdbID': 'tt0298388', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '04 Mar 2003', 'BoxOffice': '$25,408,198', 'Production': 'Artisan Entertainment', 'Website': 'http://www.jonahmovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
