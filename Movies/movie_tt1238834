This launches a flashback how Heathcliff was raised as Cathy's best friend by her kind father, Mr. Earnshaw. After his death, the son and heir returns from boarding school, married, and reduces Heathcliff to the rank of stable boy, enduring constant abuse in order to remain with Cathy. After an accidental meeting with elegant gentleman Edgar Linton, she falls in love. To Hindley's delight, this drives Heathcliff away. [PART II] Three years later, Heathcliff returns wealthy enough to buy the estate, a day after Cathy married Edgar. He takes revenge, which instead of satisfaction brings misery to all. After Cathy and later Edgar's death, his scorn includes the next generation, which nevertheless finds each-other striving for nobler values.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'UK', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTQzMzQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1MjA2MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.7/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '7.7', 'imdbVotes': '6,972', 'imdbID': 'tt1238834', 'Type': 'series', 'totalSeasons': '1', 'Response': 'True'}
