That is when he discovers Nathaniel Ayers, a mentally ill, homeless street musician who possesses extraordinary talent, even through his half-broken instruments. Inspired by his story, Lopez writes an acclaimed series of articles about Ayers and attempts to do more to help both him and the rest of the underclass of LA have a better life. However, Lopez's good intentions run headlong in the hard realities of the strength of Ayers' personal demons and the larger social injustices facing the homeless. Regardless, Lopez and Ayers must find a way to conquer their deepest anxieties and frustrations to hope for a brighter future for both of them.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'UK, France, USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODQ3MTI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEyMTQ5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '57%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '61/100'}], 'Metascore': '61', 'imdbRating': '6.7', 'imdbVotes': '47,767', 'imdbID': 'tt0821642', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '04 Aug 2009', 'BoxOffice': '$31,670,931', 'Production': 'Dreamworks/Paramount', 'Website': 'http://www.SoloistMovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
