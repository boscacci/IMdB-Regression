He reads minds and confounds his doctors, lead by Nathan Gross. Before the war, in Berlin, Adam was an entertainer--cabaret impresario, circus owner, magician, musician--loved by audiences and Nazis alike until he finds himself in a concentration camp, confronted by Commandant Klein. Adam survives the camp by becoming the Commandant\'s "dog", entertaining him while his wife and daughter are sent off to die. Years later we find him at the Institute. One day, Adam smells something, hears a sound. "Who brought a dog in here?" he asks Gross. Gross denies there is a dog but Adam finds him--a young boy raised in a basement on a chain. Adam and the boy see and recognize each other as dogs--and their journey begins. "Adam Resurrected" is the story of a man who once was a dog who meets a dog who once was a boy.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Germany, USA, Israel', 'Awards': '1 win.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjg4M2E3OTItMTU4ZS00YTM5LWI3ZWEtMjU4YjhjNTJkMWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '35%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '58/100'}], 'Metascore': '58', 'imdbRating': '6.3', 'imdbVotes': '3,381', 'imdbID': 'tt0479341', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '22 Sep 2009', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Bleiberg Entertainment', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
