Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Germany, UK', 'Awards': '3 wins & 21 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NzM1ODgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5MjAzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '69%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '66/100'}], 'Metascore': '66', 'imdbRating': '6.3', 'imdbVotes': '341,760', 'imdbID': 'tt0181852', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '11 Nov 2003', 'BoxOffice': '$150,252,753', 'Production': 'Warner Bros.
