This film would surpass the wildest expectation of everyone involved to become one of the most successful independent films of all time. It caught the public imagination which met the spirit of the times, even as the self appointed guardians of public morality struggled to suppress it, and created, for a brief moment, a possible future where sexuality in film had a bold artistic potential. This film covers the story of the making of this controversial film, its stunning success, its hysterical opposition along with its dark side of mob influence and allegations of the on set mistreatment of the film\'s star. In short, the combined events would redefine the popular appeal of pornography, even as more cynical developments would lead it down other paths.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTkyMjk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2MDgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '83%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '64/100'}], 'Metascore': '64', 'imdbRating': '6.7', 'imdbVotes': '6,106', 'imdbID': 'tt0418753', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '20 Sep 2005', 'BoxOffice': '$479,143', 'Production': 'Universal Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.insidedeepthroatmovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
