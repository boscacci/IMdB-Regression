Like most American ranchers, he owes his bank. Unlike most, he's an astrophysicist with a rocket in his barn - one he's built and wants to take into space. It's his dream. The FBI puts him under surveillance when he tries to buy rocket fuel; the FAA stalls him when he files a flight plan - it's post-9/11, after all. His wife is angry when she finds out their bank is initiating foreclosure. Charlie fears failure and decides, precipitously, to launch. Are twenty-first century American dreams just a sign of insanity? Are those who believe in dreamers only fools?", 'Language': 'English, Spanish', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NzkwMzA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc0ODU0MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '58%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '55/100'}], 'Metascore': '55', 'imdbRating': '6.3', 'imdbVotes': '21,132', 'imdbID': 'tt0469263', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '10 Jul 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$10,953,736', 'Production': 'Warner Independent Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.theastronautfarmermovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
