At the early age of 12, he witnessed the death of his father at the hands of local military authorities, during a well-meant attempt to hand-over a package of drugs he had incidentally found at sea while fishing. As a result of this experience, Julian develops a thirst for revenge that leads him to kill all those involved in his father's death. In the process he becomes a major drug lord and a very powerful headman within Dominican society. Nevertheless, despite his overwhelming power and easy access to everything and anything he could want out of life, he meets a woman who drives him to self-confrontation: Laura, who despite having experienced life events far more dramatic than those lived by Julian, decides to choose a path of love rather than one of vengeance. Ultimately, Julian carries-out his plan, which includes the murder of someone very dear to him, only to realize - through Laura - that his life is now far emptier than it ever was.", 'Language': 'Spanish', 'Country': 'Dominican Republic', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUyMjAwNjgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEwMDA1Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '6.9', 'imdbVotes': '201', 'imdbID': 'tt2275671', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': 'N/A', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
