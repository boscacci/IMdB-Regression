And Maddy is a vacuous soap opera actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine year old father, Lou Mozell, when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization.

As the emotional aspect of looking after Lou becomes more and more stressful, Eve has to figure out how to maintain her own sanity, while dealing with her sisters, who believe they too are part of their father's care while they don't lift a finger to help.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Germany, USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJjYjgwZjMtYThhZi00NzNlLWI0Y2YtZjkxYWNlYWI2ZDJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '4.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '12%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '33/100'}], 'Metascore': '33', 'imdbRating': '4.8', 'imdbVotes': '11,123', 'imdbID': 'tt0162983', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '27 Jun 2000', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures Home Entertainment', 'Website': 'http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/hangingup/index.html', 'Response': 'True'}
