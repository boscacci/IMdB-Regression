Johns, religious man Abu Al-Walid, Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway teenager Jack, settlers John \'Zeke\' Ezekiel and his lover Sharon \'Shazza\' Montgomery, and Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous escaped convict. Marooned, the survivors discover the barren and hot desert-scape has sunlight from three suns. Not only must they find food and water and worry about Riddick, the survivors find themselves being hunted by the planet\'s flesh-eating alien inhabitants when the planet is engulfed in darkness, which happens every 22 years, as they emerge from underground to hunt and eat all signs of life. Fry and the survivors find Riddick is their best chance of survival, as Riddick has surgically-enhanced eyes that allow him to see in the dark as they set out to find a way of escaping from the planet and getting to a escape shuttle, before they all get eaten by the creatures on the surface.', 'Language': 'English, Arabic', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTNmYzE1OWYtZDdjNC00OTdhLTg1YjUtYWJlZTVkMzkzNmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '59%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '49/100'}], 'Metascore': '49', 'imdbRating': '7.1', 'imdbVotes': '211,250', 'imdbID': 'tt0134847', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '24 Oct 2000', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Gramercy Pictures/ USA Films', 'Website': 'http://www.pitch-black.com/blackbox/index.html', 'Response': 'True'}
