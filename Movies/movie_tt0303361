May becomes a lonely, weird young woman, working in an animal hospital and assisting the veterinarian in surgeries and sewing operated animals most of the time. Her lesbian colleague Polly has a sort of attraction for her. When the shy May meets the mechanic Adam Stubbs, she loves his hands and has a crush on him. They date, but the weirdness and bizarre behavior of May pushes Adam away from her. Alone, May has a brief affair with Polly, but she feels rejected again when her colleague meets Ambrosia. When her doll is accidentally broken, the deranged May decides to build a friend for her, using the best parts her acquaintances can offer.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '9 wins & 8 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUwYzdjMjAtN2FjMS00NDNhLWJlNjYtODBkNzllYTFjMjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '68%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '58/100'}], 'Metascore': '58', 'imdbRating': '6.7', 'imdbVotes': '30,169', 'imdbID': 'tt0303361', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '15 Jul 2003', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Lionsgate Releasing', 'Website': 'http://www.maythemovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
