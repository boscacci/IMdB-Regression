But Frank's got a drinking problem and when he messes up a critical assignment that puts the family business in peril, his uncle sends him to San Francisco to clean up his act. Frank is not a touchy-feely kind of guy, but he starts going to AA meetings, gets a sponsor and a job at a mortuary where he falls for the tart-tongued Laurel, a woman who is dangerously devoid of boundaries. Meanwhile, things aren't going well in Buffalo where an upstart Irish gang is threatening the family business. When violence erupts, Frank is forced to return home and with an unlikely assist from Laurel, faces old rivals on new terms.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyMjg3NDE4MDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDg2NzE4NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '78%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '64/100'}], 'Metascore': '64', 'imdbRating': '6.5', 'imdbVotes': '17,068', 'imdbID': 'tt0796375', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 Oct 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$2,311,434', 'Production': 'IFC Films', 'Website': 'http://youkillmethefilm.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
