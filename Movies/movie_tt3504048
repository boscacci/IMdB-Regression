Her punishment is made all the more unbearable by the fact she has to live there with her mother Miriam - a well-intentioned blabbermouth who's convinced that the house is haunted. Kylie dismisses Miriam's superstitions as nothing more than a distraction from a life occupied by boiled vegetables & small-town gossip. However, when she too becomes privy to unsettling whispers & strange bumps in the night, she begins to wonder whether she's inherited her overactive imagination, or if the house is in fact possessed by a hostile spirit who's less than happy about the new living arrangement.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'New Zealand', 'Awards': '5 wins & 22 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTA5NTAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE2NDkyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '97%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '76/100'}], 'Metascore': '76', 'imdbRating': '6.8', 'imdbVotes': '29,076', 'imdbID': 'tt3504048', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '18 Nov 2014', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Xlrator Media', 'Website': 'http://houseboundthemovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
