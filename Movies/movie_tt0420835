Kelly-Anne's and Ashmol's father is an opal miner trying to earn a living, and their mother is busy trying to fit in as a member of the community. Both parents agree that it's time for Kelly-Ann to move on and leave her fantasy world behind - but when they force her to grow up too fast with a hasty decision, Pobby and Dingan are killed and Kelly-Ann falls into a grief-stricken illness.
