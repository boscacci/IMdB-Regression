He works in a video store; he's eager, chatty, sleeps in his car. She rents adult films, looks disheveled, rarely speaks. He chats her up, she brushes him off. He takes her address from store records and contrives to run into her. He rings her doorbell; she tells him to go away. He invents a story of a great-aunt who's died; she lets him in but holds a butcher knife between them. So it goes. He presses for a relationship; she ignores him, insults him, or yells. He's persistent, inviting her out, cooking, washing her hair. Both have demons and, as their natures become more clear, his addictive personality and her sex nausea may be on a collision course.", 'Language': 'English, Polish, German', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQyMjAxNjU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5ODg5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '50%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '54/100'}], 'Metascore': '54', 'imdbRating': '6.4', 'imdbVotes': '7,293', 'imdbID': 'tt0944101', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '01 Sep 2009', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': '42 West', 'Website': 'http://www.gooddickthefilm.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
