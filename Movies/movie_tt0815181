Interviews with employees and former employees of such companies as Halliburton, CACI, and KBR suggest that government cronyism is behind apparent "sweetheart" deals that give such contractors enormous freedom to profit from supplying support and material to American troops while providing little oversight. Survivors of employees who were killed discuss the claim that the companies cared more for profit than for the welfare of their own workers, and soldiers indicate that the quality of services provided is sub-standard and severely in contradiction to the comparatively huge profits being generated. Also depicted are the unsuccessful attempts by the filmmakers to get company spokesmen to respond to the charges made by the interviewees.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDQ4MzUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI0MDczMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '100%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '68/100'}], 'Metascore': '68', 'imdbRating': '7.7', 'imdbVotes': '1,528', 'imdbID': 'tt0815181', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '26 Sep 2006', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Brave New Films', 'Website': 'http://iraqforsale.org', 'Response': 'True'}
