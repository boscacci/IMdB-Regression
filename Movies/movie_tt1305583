It\'s lesson number one for any newly engaged couple, and Lucia and Marcus are no exception. In Our Family Wedding, they learn the hard way that the path to saying "I do" can be rife with familial strife. When they return from college and too suddenly announce their marriage plans, they soon discover that their fathers - two highly competitive over-the-top egos - can wreak a major amount of havoc on their special day. With insults flying and tempers running high, it\'s anyone\'s guess if the alpha dads will survive to make it down the aisle in one piece. Lucia\'s mother is busy planning the wedding of "her" dreams and the only levelheaded one in the bunch is Angela, the groom\'s father\'s best friend and lawyer, who manages to keep her cool when the madness reaches a crescendo.
