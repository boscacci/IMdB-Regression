She's loquacious to a fault. When kids at a career day make fun of her for being single, she accepts a blind date with Steve, the cameraman for a CNN-like news network. Within minutes she decides he's the man for her. He's quickly put off by her constant verbiage and over-the-top advances; he makes an off-hand remark about going on the road with her, and splits. She's moonstruck, writes a sappy crossword puzzle, loses her job, and decides to follow him as the news team crisscrosses the Southwest; Steve's team eggs her on. Then she falls in a mine shaft, and she and Steve become a story; is it a love story?", 'Language': 'English, Spanish, French, American Sign Language', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5MTQxOTE2OTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY5NzI4NzI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '4.8/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '6%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '17/100'}], 'Metascore': '17', 'imdbRating': '4.8', 'imdbVotes': '36,641', 'imdbID': 'tt0881891', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '22 Dec 2009', 'BoxOffice': '$33,806,061', 'Production': '20th Century Fox', 'Website': 'http://www.allaboutstevemovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
