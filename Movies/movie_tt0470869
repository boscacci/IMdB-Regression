Neal just wants what all guys want - to have a deep, meaningful relationship, full of conversation and shopping - NOT. For him it is pretty simple - Canada is full of hot women, and he has that little "lost boy" charm that they love so much. So if they want to take him home, and cuddle him - well why should HE complain? After all he has just 21 days before he has to waves farewell to his bachelor life. LIVE IT UP. It\'s a little more complex with Nikki - First there is Trish, then there are all these jobs she keeps quitting and then there\'s the fact that - Well, she\'s hot, she is sexy, so why not have some fun? She\'s going to do whatever she wants to do - so everyone out of her way. In a journey that takes them all over British Columbia in Canada, they both begin to realize that maybe what they were looking for was sitting right next to them, all this time. But hey - Don\'t be so sure. After all it\'s Neal. It\'s Nikki. And it\'s going to be quite a trip.', 'Language': 'English, Hindi, French', 'Country': 'India', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMwODgwYWItZWViOC00YjhlLWFjYjctMmExZTBlYjI4ODkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTkzNDQ4ODc@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '3.3/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '3.3', 'imdbVotes': '1,277', 'imdbID': 'tt0470869', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '28 Mar 2006', 'BoxOffice': '$100,358', 'Production': 'Yash Raj Films', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
