Truman commissioned a top-secret residential development in a remote area of the Pacific Northwest, one that would serve to protect and nurture America\'s most valuable intellectual resources. There our nation\'s greatest thinkers, the über-geniuses working on the next era of scientific achievement, would be able to live and work in a supportive environment. The best architects and planners were commissioned to design a welcoming place for these superlative geniuses to reside, an area that would offer the best education for their children, the best healthcare, the best amenities and quality of life. A community was created to rival the most idyllic of America\'s small towns - with one major difference: this town would never appear on any maps.
