His mother has just died. His father, a building contractor, can barely keep tabs on his young girlfriend, let alone his own son. Thusly, the teen must navigate his adolescence virtually unsupervised. Floating towards an ill-behaved existence, Howie and his crowd begin robbing houses in the middle-class neighborhoods off the Long Island Expressway. Together, he and his best friend Gary break into a place belonging to an old guy named Big John, a local man who is a respected pillar of the community. When Big John fingers Gary for the crime, Howie learns that his pal has been leading a secret, dangerous but also alluring double life. Subsequently, we also discover that Big John has secrets of his own.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '20 wins & 18 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdkMDNlMmMtM2MxNC00Nzg4LTg5NGYtZjJkOWY4YmViNDBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.2/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '83%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '73/100'}], 'Metascore': '73', 'imdbRating': '7.2', 'imdbVotes': '9,088', 'imdbID': 'tt0242587', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '04 Jun 2002', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Lot 47 Films', 'Website': 'http://www.lot47films.com/lie', 'Response': 'True'}
