However he\'s a thorn in the side of the rich rancher Murphy, as he\'s a competitor in selling cattle. One day he\'s shot by Murphy\'s men. Judge Wilson can\'t do anything, since Sheriff Brady is one of Murphy\'s men. But attorney Alex persuades him to constitute Tunstall\'s young friends to Deputies and give them warrants of arrest for the murderers. Instead of arresting them, William Bonney just shoots them down. Soon the 5 guys become famous and William gets the name "Billie the Kid" - but they\'re also chased by dozens of Murphy\'s men and the army.
