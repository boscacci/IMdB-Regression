The foremost goal in making this movie is to educate and enlighten audiences with the story of this car, its place in history and in the larger story of our car culture and how it enables our continuing addiction to foreign oil. This is an important film with an important message that not only calls to task the officials who squelched the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, but all of the other accomplices, government, the car companies, Big Oil, even Eco-darling Hydrogen as well as consumers, who turned their backs on the car and embrace embracing instead the SUV. Our documentary investigates the death and resurrection of the electric car, as well as the role of renewable energy and sustainable living in our country's future; issues which affect everyone from progressive liberals to the neo-conservative right.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MTM0MTA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk1OTIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '88%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '70/100'}], 'Metascore': '70', 'imdbRating': '7.7', 'imdbVotes': '11,787', 'imdbID': 'tt0489037', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '14 Nov 2006', 'BoxOffice': '$1,324,335', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures Classics', 'Website': 'http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
