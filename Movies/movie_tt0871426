Undaunted, the driven Kate allows South Philly working girl Angie Ostrowiski to become her unlikely surrogate. Simple enough ... After learning from the steely head of their surrogacy center that Angie is pregnant, Kate goes into precision nesting mode: reading childcare books, baby-proofing the apartment and researching top pre-schools. But the executive's well-organized strategy is turned upside down when her Baby Mama shows up at her doorstep with no place to live. An unstoppable force meets an immovable object as structured Kate tries to turn vibrant Angie into the perfect expectant mom. In a battle of wills, they will struggle their way through preparation for the baby's arrival. And in the middle of this tug-of-war, they'll discover two kinds of family: the one you're born to and the one you make.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 5 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNTc1Nzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4OTI2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '64%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '55/100'}], 'Metascore': '55', 'imdbRating': '6.0', 'imdbVotes': '38,398', 'imdbID': 'tt0871426', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 Sep 2008', 'BoxOffice': '$60,269,340', 'Production': 'Universal Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.babymamamovie.net/', 'Response': 'True'}
