Beautiful, highly talented and restless, Grace is so far undiscovered outside church. She performs there each Sunday with her gifted father Johnny, the praise music director at Freedom Community Chapel, a small town Alabama church. A former rock star, Johnny Trey charted a Billboard number one single 20 years before. When the hits stopped coming he crash landed hard, a one hit wonder. Johnny found Christ and a new life for his family, far from the Hollywood Hills. One day without warning, Grace leaves for Los Angeles. She has landed a record deal with the help of Johnny\'s ruthless former manager and producer Frank "Mossy" Mostin. Mossy sees in Grace a potential pop superstar - the next Katy Perry. Cutting off contact with her parents, Grace seems prepared to walk away from her Christian faith and music to achieve her long-suppressed fantasy of Hollywood super stardom. Will the experience cause her to reject her faith, or rediscover it?', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA4MzY3MzA1MTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY1MTE2Nzk@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.2/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '50%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '39/100'}], 'Metascore': '39', 'imdbRating': '6.2', 'imdbVotes': '2,930', 'imdbID': 'tt2349460', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '11 Feb 2014', 'BoxOffice': '$2,507,106', 'Production': 'Roadside Attractions', 'Website': 'http://graceunplugged.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
