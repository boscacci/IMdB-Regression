The late founder, Papa Muntz, was famed for skiing with his backside exposed, and in fact is so memorialized by a statue. But his son, Ted, plans to sell the resort to hotshot ski mogul John Majors, who starts turning it into a slick resort, which of course has no room for most of the staff. The exception is Rick, the most serious of the bunch. But there's a complication: Rick met Majors' stepdaughter Anna on vacation in Mexico, and he's never gotten over a crush he had on her, even though she's about to marry a great guy. And Rick is also fiercely loyal to his friends.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NTczOTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzcyNTQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '8%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '22/100'}], 'Metascore': '22', 'imdbRating': '6.3', 'imdbVotes': '15,673', 'imdbID': 'tt0253798', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '21 May 2002', 'BoxOffice': '$13,850,403', 'Production': 'Buena Vista Distribution Compa', 'Website': 'http://bventertainment.go.com/movies/outcold/main.html', 'Response': 'True'}
