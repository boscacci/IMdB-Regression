Jane is the affluent matriarch whose 3 daughters seem to have nothing in common except for a peculiar sort of idealism. Setting the tone of vanity and insecurity, Jane is undergoing cosmetic surgery to alter her figure, but serious complications put her health in real danger. Former homecoming queen Michelle, the eldest daughter, has one daughter of her own and an alienated, unsupportive husband. Elizabeth, the middle sister, has an acting career that is beginning to take off, but is timid and insecure, and habitually relieves her trepidation by taking in stray dogs. Only the youngest sister, Annie, an adopted African American 8-year-old, stands a chance of avoiding the family legacy of anxious self-absorption. If only her intelligence and curiosity will see her through what promises to be a confusing adolescence. Each of the women seeks redemption in her own haphazard way.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '3 wins & 14 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODViNWFlNzctOGNmZS00MGM2LWE1MGQtMzc3YWU1MjM0NzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '86%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '75/100'}], 'Metascore': '75', 'imdbRating': '6.9', 'imdbVotes': '6,454', 'imdbID': 'tt0258273', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '26 Nov 2002', 'BoxOffice': '$4,186,931', 'Production': 'Lions Gate Releasing', 'Website': 'http://www.lovelyandamazing.com', 'Response': 'True'}
