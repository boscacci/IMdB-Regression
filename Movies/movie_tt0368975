As a trio, they end up having the adventure of their lives. To win the legendary high school lunch spot by the fountains, they must win a all-night scavenger hunt against their popular girl rivals. Unfortunately, Julie's mom has firm rules about the party. Her number one rule? Don't leave the house. But Julie and her friends won't let a little thing like parental authority stand in the way of social domination. To win the race, they sneak out of the house, steal a car, snatch a cute boy's boxer shorts, crash a high school dance, and torment a security guard with an inflated ego. And along the way, some of the girls might just find love. Because anything is possible at Julie's sleepover.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA4ODg1OTk2MjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDc4MzIyNzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '15%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '33/100'}], 'Metascore': '33', 'imdbRating': '5.4', 'imdbVotes': '14,092', 'imdbID': 'tt0368975', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '23 Nov 2004', 'BoxOffice': '$8,070,311', 'Production': 'MGM', 'Website': 'http://www.sleepovermovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
