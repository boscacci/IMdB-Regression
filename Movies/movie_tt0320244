Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York, and came to be an underground legend, known for his excessive drug use and outrageous behavior in the club world. At his peak, he had his own record label, and magazine, and hosted Disco 2000, one of the biggest club nights in New York in the '90s. He was doing a lot of drugs, and as his addiction got worse, his party themes became darker and more twisted. Alig's saga reached its tragic crescendo when he viciously murdered his drug dealer, Angel, by injecting him with Drano and throwing him in the East River. The power he wielded on the club scene made him feel untouchable, so he didn't hesitate to boast of the murder. The press thought it was a publicity stunt--until Angel's body washed ashore.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Netherlands', 'Awards': '4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZlMWM1MGEtY2M5OS00MWZhLWI1OGUtYTAwY2JlM2U1ZTgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '29%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '36/100'}], 'Metascore': '36', 'imdbRating': '6.3', 'imdbVotes': '13,865', 'imdbID': 'tt0320244', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '10 Feb 2004', 'BoxOffice': '$296,665', 'Production': 'Strand Releasing', 'Website': 'http://www.partymonster.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
