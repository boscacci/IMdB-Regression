In the line of duty he comes across a stranded Zaara (Preity Zinta) - a girl from Pakistan who has come to India to fulfill her surrogate mothers dying wish. Veer saves her life and his life is never the same again. Twenty two years later Saamia Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), a Pakistani human rights lawyer on her first case, finds herself face to face with an ageing Veer Pratap Singh. He has languished in a Pakistan jail cell for 22 years and has not spoken to anyone all these years. And no one knows why. Her mission is to discover the truth about Veer and see to it that justice is served. VEER-ZAARA is a saga of love, separation, courage and sacrifice. A love that is divine, a love that is whole-hearted, a love that is completely consuming, a love that grows with separation and deepens with sacrifice. A love that is an inspiration - and will remain a legend forever.', 'Language': 'Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi', 'Country': 'India', 'Awards': '21 wins & 29 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VlOTc4ZjctYjVlMS00NDYwLWEwZjctZmYzZmVkNGU5NjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '92%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '67/100'}], 'Metascore': '67', 'imdbRating': '7.9', 'imdbVotes': '43,677', 'imdbID': 'tt0420332', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '26 Feb 2005', 'BoxOffice': '$2,856,738', 'Production': 'Yash Raj Films Pvt.
