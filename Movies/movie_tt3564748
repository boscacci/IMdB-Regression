Fifty years later this institution was nearly empty and collapsing - enrollment down, facilities crumbling, sports teams a joke, and nearly 20% of the students technically homeless. Students with any means had left, finding safer and newer schools elsewhere, leaving the less fortunate students still at Roosevelt attempting to survive in a war zone. By 2007 things were so bad the superintendent of schools had slated the once grand school for closure. All that begin to change in 2008. SouthLake Church was like many suburban churches in the Northwest. It's gleaming facilities full of professionals, young people and traditional families eager to worship God and experience teaching in a comfortable and convenient environment. When Pastor Kip Jacob agreed to participate in a clean-up day at Roosevelt, he expected a couple hundred of his most faithful would show up, get their hands dirty for a few hours, then hop back in their SUVs and head home to the 'burbs. But what happened no one expected. UnDivided is a sobering, inspirational documentary exploring relationships forged between SouthLake volunteers and the kids at Roosevelt; revealing the daily challenges many students face in an under-served community and how church members individually and collectively can appropriately engage in those challenges; and it reveals how this involvement ultimately has a profound effect on the volunteers.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3Njg3Njg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIxNjY0MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': 'N/A', 'imdbVotes': 'N/A', 'imdbID': 'tt3564748', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': 'N/A', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
