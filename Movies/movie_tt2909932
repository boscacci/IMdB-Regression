Peter, after becoming an embarrassment to the History Department, is forced to resign his position at BOSTON UNIVERSITY due to his drinking and his single minded obsession with the submarine story. That evening, Peter receives a mysterious visit from a man from the Department of the Navy. After years and years of trying, Peter is allowed to visit the submarine. Assembling his team of researchers and graduate students, including is ex-wife, Peter plans to finally perform research on board, and his team head to the USS LIONFISH... the first people to be allowed on the boat for over 80 years since... the event. Once on board, they become trapped by the boat itself and things only get worse for the team as the boat comes to life, and heads out to sea diving them into a pitched battle in 1943 with a German U-boat and attacked by their own US NAVY destroyer... Peter and his team are thrust into the untenable position of continuing to fight the LIONFISH, in order to save themselves, or changing sides, and fighting with the USS LIONFISH.
