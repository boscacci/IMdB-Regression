There are no suspects. With Harper Lee, he visits the town: he wants to write about their response. First he must get locals to talk, then, after arrests, he must gain access to the prisoners. One talks constantly; the other, Perry Smith, says little. Capote is implacable, wanting the story, believing this book will establish a new form of reportage: he must figure out what Perry wants. Their relationship becomes something more than writer and character: Perry killed in cold blood, the state will execute him in cold blood; does Capote get his story through cold calculation, or is there a price for him to pay?', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '3 wins & 2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NTAyODYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0MDczMjI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '73%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '68/100'}], 'Metascore': '68', 'imdbRating': '7.1', 'imdbVotes': '15,366', 'imdbID': 'tt0420609', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '13 Feb 2007', 'BoxOffice': '$1,093,888', 'Production': 'Warner Independent Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.infamousmovie.com', 'Response': 'True'}
