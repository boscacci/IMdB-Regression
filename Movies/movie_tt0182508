His encounters are planned and chance: with a homeless man who sleeps by his building, with a friend who's dying, with the couple who lives (and noisily loves) in the flat above him, with a bartender and a one-night-stand he follows home, and with a tattooed stranger whom he seeks out and befriends. Along the way, Charlie inhabits a city full of moments of violence and of stories and legends: a kidney thief, a microwaved poodle, a rat in a hot dog bun, a baby left on a car top, a tourist's toothbrush, needles in public-phone change slots. Charlie lives and tells his own stories. What caused his melancholy?", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '5 wins & 4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTlmZDVhNWUtNTcwNC00ODFmLWJhZTMtMzJjNWRkNjk3NzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '72%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '73/100'}], 'Metascore': '73', 'imdbRating': '7.0', 'imdbVotes': '2,815', 'imdbID': 'tt0182508', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '13 Mar 2001', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Trimark', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
