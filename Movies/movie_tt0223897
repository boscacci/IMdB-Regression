The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 win & 4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI3ODI5NDEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYyMjU3._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.2/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '40%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '40/100'}], 'Metascore': '40', 'imdbRating': '7.2', 'imdbVotes': '105,874', 'imdbID': 'tt0223897', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '15 May 2001', 'BoxOffice': '$32,801,029', 'Production': 'Warner Bros.
