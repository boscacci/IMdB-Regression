Shanté is so adept at navigating the waters of romance that her best girlfriends Diedre, Karen and Tracye depend on her for advice whenever "man trouble" clouds the horizon. But when Shanté\'s boyfriend Keith is caught red-handed stepping out with a co-worker, Shanté institutes her "Ten Day Plan" to get her man in line. Whether its sexy lingerie or good home cooking, Shanté has an arsenal of weapons designed to bring a man to his knees...and back to her. She\'s not above playing the damsel in distress or using the ever-reliable local grapevine to get Keith\'s attention. It\'s all good, because getting her man back - by any means necessary - is all that matters. Unfortunately the happy ending that Shanté expects goes sideways when Keith begins following the advice of his buddy Tony, who brings a player\'s perspective to the games girls play. In this comedic battle of the sexes, Shante\'s about to discover that not only are there no rules - she\'s not the only one playing. With her relationship at stake and her friends checking her every move, Shanté has to think fast and stay a step ahead of Keith if she has any hope of bringing her man back...with her pride intact.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '7 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTU5MTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY5NDIyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '43%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '35/100'}], 'Metascore': '35', 'imdbRating': '6.1', 'imdbVotes': '5,737', 'imdbID': 'tt0269341', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '26 Dec 2001', 'BoxOffice': '$22,012,529', 'Production': 'Screen Gems', 'Website': 'http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/twocanplay', 'Response': 'True'}
