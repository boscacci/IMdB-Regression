A couple of days later, the grieving Abe misses his family and commits suicide ingesting many pills at home, but is rescued by his friend Marty Bloom and saved by the doctors. His Near Death Experience makes him see white light in some people and to hear Electronic Voice Phenomena, i.e., manifestations of voices of ghosts or spirits through static on electronic devices. Soon he discovers that the white light means that the person is going to die, and Abe saves three lives including his nurse Sherry Clarke. While watching a video recorded by his son, Abe finds that the killer had saved the lives of his wife and son three days before the murder. He investigates the incident and finds that when you save, you must kill; otherwise many innocents will die three days later.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Canada', 'Awards': '5 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk2YzUyOTQtMDIwNy00ZWQxLTkwNzYtNTliMjZhNmE4MmYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '75%'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '5.7', 'imdbVotes': '12,071', 'imdbID': 'tt0496436', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '08 Jan 2008', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Universal Studios', 'Website': 'http://whitenoisethelight.net/', 'Response': 'True'}
