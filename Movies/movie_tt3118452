Every two minutes, one of them must die... Executed by an electrical pulse generated from a source within the chamber. At first the attacks seem random, but, soon the strangers realize that they, as a group, have the power to decide who will be the next to be killed: by the power of the vote. Mob mentality at its finest hour. A chance to control the machine. How will they choose who deserves to die? What happens when there\'s only one person left? "Circle" is a film about humanity. How we value one another and how people react when they are forced to make decisions under the worst possible circumstances. It\'s a film that speaks to the very core of what makes us human - Who we are, what we believe and ultimately, the lengths we will go to in which to save ourselves.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mjg0MjUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk0NzQ4NzE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.0/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '6.0', 'imdbVotes': '27,957', 'imdbID': 'tt3118452', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '05 Jul 2016', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Taggart Productions', 'Website': 'https://www.facebook.com/circlefilm', 'Response': 'True'}
