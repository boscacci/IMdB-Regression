He is refused employment initially, but when he offers to work for free, Dahlia hires him as a cleaner. When a hair-stylist named Debbie quits, Zohan replaces her, winning over elderly female client√®le, and falling in love with Dahlia herself. Before Zohan could propose to her, Dahlia's landlord, Walbridge, who has been raising rents regularly, hires skinhead goons to terrorize the neighborhood, creates misunderstandings between Jews, Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians, and drives them out, so as to enable him to construct a new building which is topped by a roller coaster. When Zohan decides to confront these skinheads, he does not realize that he is in for quite a few surprises himself.", 'Language': 'English, Hebrew', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE2MzEzNDc5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYxOTA3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '37%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '54/100'}], 'Metascore': '54', 'imdbRating': '5.5', 'imdbVotes': '174,070', 'imdbID': 'tt0960144', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '07 Oct 2008', 'BoxOffice': '$100,018,837', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.youdontmesswiththezohan.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
