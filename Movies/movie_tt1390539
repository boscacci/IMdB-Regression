When Billy and his friends are not jumping off waterfalls, avoiding animal traps, crossing the ocean, sneaking through caves or escaping a prison, they're facing their nemesis Cobra, who wants nothing more than for them all to disappear. With no other way to get home, and the well-being of the entire island resting on his shoulders, Billy must discover the key to reclaiming the medallion and its tremendous power.
