"But how many people lose their faith because Heaven showed them too much?" Daggett nearly became a priest; now he\'s a cop. He may want to put religion behind him, but one morning a weird, eyeless, hermaphroditic corpse turns up. Suddenly he is on a path that will put him right in the middle of a war in Heaven. And once again, Heaven will show him too much: gore, blood, charred flesh, living corpses and much worse. Even more central to the heavenly war effort is a young girl. This American Indian child has something Gabriel wants. And Gabriel is willing to kill her and anyone in his path - or even reanimate a corpse or two - to get it.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM4N2I0ZjYtMTFmNC00ZGQ0LWIzNmMtZDZjNzIwOGM1NzA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '43%'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '6.5', 'imdbVotes': '26,481', 'imdbID': 'tt0114194', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 Feb 1999', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Dimension Films', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
