Naturally, her parents are searching for a wealthy, well-appointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley, nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham, as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy, sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire - then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends and fortune.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'UK, Ireland', 'Awards': '3 wins & 6 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjQyMDMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwOTM1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.1/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '58%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '55/100'}], 'Metascore': '55', 'imdbRating': '7.1', 'imdbVotes': '53,069', 'imdbID': 'tt0416508', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '12 Feb 2008', 'BoxOffice': '$18,602,895', 'Production': 'Miramax Films', 'Website': 'http://www.miramax.com/movie/becoming-jane', 'Response': 'True'}
