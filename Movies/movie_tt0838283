The sons still live with the parents so they must now share a room. Initial antipathy threatens the household's peace and the parents' relationship. Dad lays down the law: both slackers have a week to find a job. Out of the job search and their love of music comes a pact that leads to friendship but more domestic disarray compounded by the boys' sleepwalking. Hovering nearby are Brennan's successful brother and his lonely wife: the brother wants to help sell his step-father's house, the wife wants Dale's attention, and the newlyweds want to retire and sail the seven seas. Can harmony come from the discord?", 'Language': 'English, Spanish', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '3 wins & 2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODViZDg3ZjYtMzhiYS00YTVkLTk4MzktYWUxMTlkYjc1NjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '55%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '51/100'}], 'Metascore': '51', 'imdbRating': '6.9', 'imdbVotes': '241,021', 'imdbID': 'tt0838283', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '02 Dec 2008', 'BoxOffice': '$100,468,793', 'Production': 'Columbia Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/stepbrothers/index.html', 'Response': 'True'}
