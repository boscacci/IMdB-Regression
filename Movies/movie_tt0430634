But the rebellious Haley is not welcomed into the academy by the other teenage gymnasts who despise her for walking out on her Junior Olympic team years earlier during a competition which cost them the gold medal. But Haley is not a docile person either and makes every effort to provoke conflicts with the other girls. Vickerman takes it upon himself to coach Haley in his own way to make her regain her self respect for the VGA's coming spot on the Gymnastic Nationals.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Germany, USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MDAzMDgzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc1ODQzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '31%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '53/100'}], 'Metascore': '53', 'imdbRating': '6.4', 'imdbVotes': '24,830', 'imdbID': 'tt0430634', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '19 Sep 2006', 'BoxOffice': '$26,870,825', 'Production': 'Buena Vista', 'Website': 'http://www.stickitmovie.com', 'Response': 'True'}
