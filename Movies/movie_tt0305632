Her son Scott is mortified. He still can't believe that his father - a world-class athlete - actually drowned. When Maureen and Oliver announce wedding-plans, Scott's world begins to fall apart. Oliver's attractive daughter Kelly shares Scott's distrust of the impending marriage - and proposes a theory of her own: is it possible that Maureen and Oliver have known each other longer than just a few weeks; and if so, could they have possibly killed Scott's father? The two start to investigate - and soon fall in love. But while they are united by a horrible suspicion, the investigation soon reveals some secrets that keep them apart. Scott has to realize that he can truly trust no one - not Oliver, not Maureen and definitely not Kelly.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Germany, UK', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMDExODUyODleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDc4MzY3MzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '3.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '4%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '13/100'}], 'Metascore': '13', 'imdbRating': '3.3', 'imdbVotes': '1,241', 'imdbID': 'tt0305632', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '31 May 2005', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'MGM/UA', 'Website': 'http://www.fascinationthemovie.com', 'Response': 'True'}
