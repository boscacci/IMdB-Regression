After some hazing he buckles up to learn the hard work and gets accepted by the rough crew. Then Royal Navy lieutenant John Merrick is welcomed to take charge of security on a long voyage to Sidney and Calcutta, through pirates-infested waters, but Haakon distrusts him after finding out that he packed concealed weapons; indeed Merrick secretly poisons the captain. Haakon and his guardian angel, his father's best mate Jens, were about to feel the claw of the cat for helping a stowaway when a rock wrecks the ship. Haakon washes up an island where he finds a pirates treasure and weapons.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Norway, Sweden, USA', 'Awards': '3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFiMTY1ZTItNDkwYS00MzE0LWIwYjktNWE3OWY3OGNmZjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.7/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '6.7', 'imdbVotes': '2,184', 'imdbID': 'tt0099816', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '17 Jul 1991', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Filmkameratene AS', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
