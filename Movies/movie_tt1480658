His long-time art dealer, Ronny, is now an ungracefully aging hipster who desperately wants his meal ticket back. But Lars refuses to paint. His creativity comes at too high a cost - his inspiration is carnage - blood, guts and limbs. Not surprisingly, this lead to a dreadful breakdown in the past. Nevertheless, an eager Ronny arranges a teaching job for Lars at an art school in Koda Lake, a small Canadian town in the middle of nowhere. It\'s a "therapeutic" measure for Lars - a means to conquer his need to paint in the "safety" of a country retreat... That is, until Eddie comes into his life.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Canada, Denmark', 'Awards': '2 wins & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMDA3NTUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0MDMzOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '59%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '57/100'}], 'Metascore': '57', 'imdbRating': '5.7', 'imdbVotes': '1,332', 'imdbID': 'tt1480658', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '06 Aug 2013', 'BoxOffice': '$1,521', 'Production': 'Doppelg√§nger Releasing', 'Website': 'http://www.facebook.com/Eddiemovie', 'Response': 'True'}
