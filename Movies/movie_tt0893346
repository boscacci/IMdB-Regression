But in the ensuing ten years, they\'ve lost contact. So when Matt receives an invitation to Ryan\'s wedding he\'s surprised - especially that Ryan is marrying a woman! Matt interrupts his ideal alternative lifestyle to return to his hometown. He plans to rescue his former love from whatever "she-devil" has trapped him into this huge mistake. On the other hand, Ryan\'s perky fianc√© Alex takes quite the liking to Matt. Is she very cunning, disarmingly ditsy, completely adorable - or all three? As Matt tries to rekindle the old flame, Ryan is intent on putting out any sparks. Ryan dismisses their old romance as just a high school thing, but Matt realizes Ryan may still be the love of his life. All the while, Matt must deal with "his new best friend" Alex, the two families, and a hometown he thought he\'d left entirely in the past. As the wedding day fast approaches (like a meteor hurtling toward ground zero), old feelings resurface and secrets are revealed. Each of them must balance the past with the present, and make a choice that will determine the rest of their lives: the boundaries of love, sexuality and identity are never constant.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODgwODU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY0ODU2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.7/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '29%'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '5.7', 'imdbVotes': '1,431', 'imdbID': 'tt0893346', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '25 Nov 2008', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Regent Releasing', 'Website': 'http://kissthebridemovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
