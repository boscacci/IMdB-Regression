Jan Díte is released from prison after serving 15 years. He goes into semi exile in a deserted village near the German border. In flashbacks, he tells his story: he's a small, clever and quick-witted young man, stubbornly naïve, a vendor at a train station. Thanks to a patron, he becomes a waiter at upscale hotels and restaurants. We see him discover how the wealthy tick and how to please women. He strives to be a millionaire with his own hotel. Before the war, he meets Líza, a German woman in Prague. Is this his ticket to wealth or his undoing? Meanwhile, we see Jan putting a life together after prison: why was he sentenced, and who will he become?", 'Language': 'Czech, German, French, English, Italian, Korean', 'Country': 'Czech Republic, Slovakia', 'Awards': '10 wins & 12 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NjQ5NjkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI3NDU3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '7.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '79%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '72/100'}], 'Metascore': '72', 'imdbRating': '7.4', 'imdbVotes': '6,794', 'imdbID': 'tt0284363', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '17 Feb 2009', 'BoxOffice': '$600,000', 'Production': 'Sony Pictures Classics', 'Website': 'http://www.anglickykral.cz/', 'Response': 'True'}
