With the words "The Teacher will never leave this room alive," in an instant, Silvia\'s life is turned upside down as she becomes a hunted target of the killers. Placed under the protection of federal agent Tobin Keller, Silvia\'s world only grows more nightmarish. As Keller digs deeper into his eyewitnesses\' past and her secretive world of global connections, the more suspicious he becomes that she herself might be involved in the conspiracy. With every step of the way, he finds more reasons to mistrust her. Is Sylvia a victim? A suspect? Or something else entirely? And can Tobin, coping with his own personal heartache, keep her safe? Though they must depend on one another, Silvia and Tobin couldn\'t be more different. Silvia\'s strengths are words, diplomacy and the subtleties of meaning, while Tobin is all about instinct, action and reading into the most primal human behaviors. Now, as the danger of a major assassination on U.S. soil grows and Silvia\'s life hangs in the balance, Silvia and Tobin play out a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they race to stop a terrifying international crisis before it\'s too late.', 'Language': 'Aboriginal, English, French, Portuguese', 'Country': 'UK, France, Germany, USA', 'Awards': '3 wins & 2 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjMxNDUzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM2NzgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '57%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '62/100'}], 'Metascore': '62', 'imdbRating': '6.4', 'imdbVotes': '92,077', 'imdbID': 'tt0373926', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '04 Oct 2005', 'BoxOffice': '$72,515,360', 'Production': 'Universal Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.theinterpretermovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
