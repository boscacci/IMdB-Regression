With an extra man looking after base camp, Simon and Joe set off to scale the mount in one long push over several days. The peak is reached within three days, however on the descent Joe falls and breaks his leg. Despite what it means, the two continue with Simon letting Joe out on a rope for 300 meters, then descending to join him and so on. However when Joe goes out over an overhang with no way of climbing back up, Simon makes the decision to cut the rope. Joe falls into a crevasse and Simon, assuming him dead, continues back down. Joe however survives the fall and was lucky to hit a ledge in the crevasse. This is the story of how he got back down.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'UK, USA', 'Awards': '6 wins & 10 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM3NGVhNjQtYTQ3YS00MTFkLThjZjYtYWZhMWMyNTczOGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '8.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '94%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '82/100'}], 'Metascore': '82', 'imdbRating': '8.0', 'imdbVotes': '30,647', 'imdbID': 'tt0379557', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '15 Jun 2004', 'BoxOffice': '$4,527,224', 'Production': 'IFC Films', 'Website': 'http://ifcfilms.com/?CAT0=3127&CAT1=4309&SHID=19906&AID=5367&CLR=red&BCLR=CC0000', 'Response': 'True'}
