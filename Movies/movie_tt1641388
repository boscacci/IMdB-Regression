It is the story of 'Jack the Hack', a less than average, but once successful screenwriter who now faces writer's block. Desperate to meet a career-saving deadline and lock out the distractions of his troubled life, Jack arranges to be left alone and locked inside a meat cooler, with only vegetarian meals and his imagination to inspire him. As the temperature drops, the lines between reality and fiction blur, and Jack's script comes dangerously to life. Will he make the most important deadline of his career? Or is Jack 'just a hack'? While writing the script, the actual screenwriter and producer of BELOW ZERO, Signe Olynyk, arranged to have herself physically locked in the meat freezer of an abandoned, remote slaughterhouse. That's partly how this story developed. It was filmed at the same location.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'Canada', 'Awards': '6 wins & 4 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMjQwNjQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1MTEzOA@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '4.4/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '4.4', 'imdbVotes': '708', 'imdbID': 'tt1641388', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '28 Aug 2012', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'Screen Media Ventures', 'Website': 'http://www.belowzeromovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
