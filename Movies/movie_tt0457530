With more than two million copies sold, the second volume of Gerald N. Lund\'s epic series The Work and the Glory now brings a pivotal moment in American history to the big screen. "The Work and The Glory: American Zion" sets the story of the fictional Steed family against the historically factual backdrop of the Mormon people\'s move into the West. Divided by their diverse reactions to a nascent ideology, the Steeds struggle to hold together as the strength of their convictions and their filial bonds are tested. The stirring narrative of the faith that led a persecuted people to Missouri and beyond is one of the most poignant untold tales of American history. It is the account of a valiant struggle to exercise the rights promised by a fledgling nation. "The Work and the Glory: American Zion" unearths the story of the passion behind the movement which eventually launched the largest American migration and the colonization of the West: the vision of a promised land in America.', 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNjg5NTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjExMjEzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.6/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '45%'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '6.6', 'imdbVotes': '617', 'imdbID': 'tt0457530', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '09 May 2006', 'BoxOffice': '$1,897,625', 'Production': 'Vineyard Productions', 'Website': 'http://www.americanzion.com', 'Response': 'True'}
