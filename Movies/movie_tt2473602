A chance demonstration of that in prison led to a new friend who helped get him out and into a musical career. With his fire and creative daring, Brown became a star who defiantly created new possibilities in show business both on and behind the stage in face of racism and conventional thinking. Along the way, James would also become a peacemaker who redefined and raised the African-American community's feeling of self-worth when it was needed most. However, those same domineering passions would lead James Brown alienating everyone around him as his appetites became ever more self-destructive. Only after he hit rock bottom with a serious mistake does Brown realize what he needs to do make his life as the Godfather of Soul truly worthwhile.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'UK, USA', 'Awards': '6 wins & 16 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjAyMTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4NzQ4MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.9/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '80%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '71/100'}], 'Metascore': '71', 'imdbRating': '6.9', 'imdbVotes': '18,555', 'imdbID': 'tt2473602', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '06 Jan 2015', 'BoxOffice': '$22,838,662', 'Production': 'Universal Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.getonupmovie.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
