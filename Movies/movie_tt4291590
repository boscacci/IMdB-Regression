His village consists of white-painted houses located above the sea with a volcanic rock and black sand coastline, populated by young women and boys all of a similar age to Nicolas. Whilst swimming, Nicolas makes a discovery in the ocean, which is shrugged off by his mother, who, like all the women in the town has tied-back hair, is pale and wears a simple thin beige dress. Nicolas is curious, thinks that he is being lied to and starts to explore his environment, witnessing some unsettling scenes. He then finds himself taken to a hospital-like building where he, along with the others, undergoes a series of medical procedures by the women, dressed as nurses. He is befriended by one nurse, who becomes instrumental in the film's denouement. The film is not easy to categorise; it is not only enigmatic but beautifully filmed with deeply poetic imagery. It reflects the fear of the unknown, experienced by a boy on the cusp of adolescence.", 'Language': 'French', 'Country': 'France, Belgium, Spain', 'Awards': '7 wins & 15 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQxYTIxMWYtZjQzNC00MmQ4LThkYmItODJkZTM5MDg0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEwNTM2Mzc@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '6.0/10'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '77/100'}], 'Metascore': '77', 'imdbRating': '6.0', 'imdbVotes': '4,812', 'imdbID': 'tt4291590', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': 'N/A', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
