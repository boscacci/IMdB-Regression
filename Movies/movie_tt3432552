Venus, her unusual name, seems to be the most appropriate one, for this gorgeous, slender, man-eater New Yorker, who like a true Goddess of Love, leaves men powerless before her with their wallets empty. However, there is another side of Venus. Sensitive and artistic, Venus is also an aspiring ballerina who practices the art of classical ballet and studies French. In this solitary life, an unexpected meeting with a handsome and accomplished Australian photographer will have her dreaming of a new life away from everything, craving to start fresh. Right from the start, Brian, responds to Venus' call and before long, the two will make a couple. But as time moves on, minute and insignificant changes in Brian's attitude will gradually give way to indifference, exhaustion and ultimately stagnation in their relationship. Betrayed and vulnerable, torn from the ever-growing hallucinations, Venus will turn to the only person loyal to her, her own true inner self, an obscure imitation of her outer shell that demands to be loved.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, Canada', 'Awards': 'N/A', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQxMDUyMDY3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMzNjIzNzE@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.4/10'}], 'Metascore': 'N/A', 'imdbRating': '5.4', 'imdbVotes': '980', 'imdbID': 'tt3432552', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': 'N/A', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'N/A', 'Website': 'N/A', 'Response': 'True'}
