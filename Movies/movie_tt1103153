But when he meets Jen Kornfeldt, a beautiful, fun-loving computer tech recovering from a bad break-up, he finds true love...and happily trades international intrigue for domestic bliss. Three years later, Spencer and Jen are still enjoying a picture-perfect marriage - that is, until the morning after Spencer's 30th birthday. That's when Spencer and Jen learn he's the target of a multi-million dollar hit. Even worse, the hired killers have been stalking the happy couple for years, and could be anyone: friends, neighbors, the grocery store clerk, even that crabby old guy shuffling across the street. Now Spencer and Jen are on the run for their lives. As their suburban paradise turns into a paranoid game of dodge-the-bullet, they must find out who wants Spencer dead and why, all the while trying to save their marriage, manage his in-laws, keep up neighborly appearances ... and just plain survive.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '2 wins & 3 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NDIwOTcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU3NTQ0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.4/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '10%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '21/100'}], 'Metascore': '21', 'imdbRating': '5.4', 'imdbVotes': '80,833', 'imdbID': 'tt1103153', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '07 Sep 2010', 'BoxOffice': '$47,000,485', 'Production': 'Lionsgate Films', 'Website': 'http://www.killersfilm.com/', 'Response': 'True'}
