After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint. He tells stories of a woman on a blind date with a man who has testicles growing from his neck, in another a smitten woman offers her neck to her boyfriend to 'poop' on -as a sign of commitment and love. In yet another two parents take home-schooling to a whole new level of indecency, striving to give their isolated teenage son all the 'regular' torment and humiliation of puberty by bullying, peer-pressuring and even seducing him themselves. An off-beat, elephant-in-the-room type film.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA', 'Awards': '4 wins & 5 nominations.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NzQ3NDM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEzMjM3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '4.3/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '4%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '18/100'}], 'Metascore': '18', 'imdbRating': '4.3', 'imdbVotes': '90,285', 'imdbID': 'tt1333125', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '18 Jun 2013', 'BoxOffice': '$8,700,000', 'Production': 'Relativity Media', 'Website': 'http://www.facebook.com/WhatIsMovie43', 'Response': 'True'}
