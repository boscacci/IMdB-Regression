Natalie and her friends are all involved in the Folklore class being taught by Professor Wexler. Wexler regales his class with urban legends, which include Pendleton's own urban legend about a Psych professor who murdered six students at Stanley Hall 25 years ago. Natalie is the first one to suspect there's a killer on campus, especially after she has ties to all of the victims. No one, including her friends, Wexler, Dean Adams and security guard, of course, believes her until it's too late. Now she finds that she and her friends are part of the killer's ultimate urban legend.", 'Language': 'English', 'Country': 'USA, France', 'Awards': '1 win & 1 nomination.', 'Poster': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlNDRiNWMtMjU4Yy00NDc5LWI1YTUtODNmN2ViOTMzN2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg', 'Ratings': [{'Source': 'Internet Movie Database', 'Value': '5.5/10'}, {'Source': 'Rotten Tomatoes', 'Value': '19%'}, {'Source': 'Metacritic', 'Value': '35/100'}], 'Metascore': '35', 'imdbRating': '5.5', 'imdbVotes': '53,946', 'imdbID': 'tt0146336', 'Type': 'movie', 'DVD': '22 May 2001', 'BoxOffice': 'N/A', 'Production': 'TriStar Pictures', 'Website': 'http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/urbanlegend', 'Response': 'True'}
